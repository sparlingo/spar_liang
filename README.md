## Regular Setup

 ### 1. Cloning + Running Locally

  - Clone this repo with one of these options:

    - Click the 'Use this template' button at the top of the page
    - Or via the command line `git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/hugo-quickstart`

 - Start the Hugo sever & check it out:

  > Alternatively, you can run this locally with [the Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)'s by running the `netlify dev` command for more options like receiving a live preview to share (`netlify dev --live`) and the ability to test [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions) and [redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/). 


## Remove Styling

If you decide that our styling is not for you, all you'll need to do is remove the [demo-styling.css](https://github.com/netlify-templates/hugo-quickstart/blob/main/themes/netlify-basic/static/css/demo-styling.css) file.
