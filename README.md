## Regular Setup

 ### 1. Cloning + Running Locally

  - Clone this repo with one of these options:

    - Click the 'Use this template' button at the top of the page
    - Or via the command line `git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/hugo-quickstart`

 - Start the Hugo sever & check it out:

   - `hugo server -D`
   - go to [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/)

  > Alternatively, you can run this locally with [the Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)'s by running the `netlify dev` command for more options like receiving a live preview to share (`netlify dev --live`) and the ability to test [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions) and [redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/). 


 
## Styling

We've added some modern styling to this template using Sass within an external stylesheet, this will allow you to easily remove our styling and add in your own. 

If you decide that you want to keep our styling you can review our style notes below. 

### Notes on Styling

The variables below give you the ability to change the gradient colors of the blobs and are interpolated into the URL string of the background-img within the body. 

```css
// Controls the blob blur gradient colors within the main tag's svg
--top-right-blur-1: #2ebc92;
--top-right-blur-2: #ecbb50;
--bttm-left-blur-1: #ff3e89;
--bttm-left-blur-2: #0095cc;
```

## Remove Styling

If you decide that our styling is not for you, all you'll need to do is remove the [demo-styling.css](https://github.com/netlify-templates/hugo-quickstart/blob/main/themes/netlify-basic/static/css/demo-styling.css) file.

## Testing

### Included Default Testing

We’ve included some tooling that helps us maintain these templates. This template currently uses:

- [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) - to regularly update our dependencies
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - to run tests against how the template runs in the browser
- [Cypress Netlify Build Plugin](https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress) - to run our tests during our build process

If your team is not interested in this tooling, you can remove them with ease!

### Removing Renovate

In order to keep our project up-to-date with dependencies we use a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate). If you’re not interested in this tooling, delete the `renovate.json` file and commit that onto your main branch.
